## Development Workflow

### Project Structure

```
auth/
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/           # Main authentication library
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/        # Source code
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tests/      # Tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ jose/           # JOSE utilities
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ src/        # Source code
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ tests/      # Tests
â”œâ”€â”€ .changeset/         # Changesets for versioning
â””â”€â”€ turbo.json          # Turborepo configuration
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Run tests for a specific package
cd packages/core
pnpm test
```

### Code Style

We use **Prettier** for code formatting and **ESLint** for linting. The configuration is already set up in the project.

- **Format code**: `pnpm format`
- **Check formatting**: `pnpm format:check`
- **Type check**: `pnpm type-check`

**Guidelines:**

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write tests for new features
- Follow existing code patterns

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**

```bash
feat(auth): add support for OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow
fix(jose): resolve token expiration validation issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(core): add tests for session management
```

## Release Process

Releases are managed using [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). If your PR includes changes that should be noted in the changelog:

1. **Create a changeset**:

   ```bash
   pnpm changeset
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts** to describe your changes

3. **Commit the changeset** file with your PR

The maintainers will handle the actual release process.
