- [Contribute](#contribute)
- [Development workflow](#development-workflow)

## Getting Started

The following steps outline how to set up the local environment.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Fork the repository

The [Aura Auth repository](https://github.com/aura-stack-js/auth) should be forked by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right corner.

</Step>

<Step>

### Clone your fork

Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/auth.git
cd auth
```

If you're new to contributing on GitHub, see [Contributing to a project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project).

</Step>

<Step>

### Add upstream remote

An upstream remote repository should be configured to keep the fork in sync. See [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/configuring-a-remote-repository-for-a-fork).

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/aura-stack-ts/auth.git
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Install dependencies

Aura Auth uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as its package manager.

```bash
pnpm install
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## Contribute

Once the scope of the contribution is defined, changes can be implemented.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Create a new branch

Always keep your fork synced with upstream before starting new work:

```bash
# syncronize the repo
git switch master && git pull upstream master

# create a new branch to work in.
git switch -c feature/your-feature-name
```

</Step>

<Step>

### implement changes

Changes are implemented in the development environment.

Packages server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Documentation server

```bash
pnpm dev:docs
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Write or update tests

Tests must be written or updated to ensure changes are covered.

```bash
# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Code style

Type checking and formatting must be verified.

```bash
pnpm type-check
```

Format codebase:

```bash
# format code
pnpm format

# check formating
pnpm format:check
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Commit changes

Changes should be committed following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add support for OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow"
```

Push to the fork:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Open a pull request

Go to GitHub and open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/aura-stack-ts/auth/pulls) with:

- Clear and descriptive title
- Reference to related issues
- Comprehensive description of changes
- Screenshots or GIFs for UI changes (if applicable)

</Step>

</Steps>

## Development Workflow

### Project Structure

```
auth/
├── packages/
│   ├── core/           # Main authentication library
│   │   ├── src/        # Source code
│   │   └── test/      # Tests
│   └── jose/           # JOSE utilities
│       ├── src/        # Source code
│       └── test/      # Tests

├── apps/               # Example applications
└── turbo.json          # Turborepo configuration
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Best practices

- TypeScript should be used for all new code.
- Variable and function names should be meaningful.
- TSDoc comments should be added for public APIs.
- Functions should be kept small and focused.
- Tests must be written for new features.
- Existing code patterns should be followed.

Your contributions help make authentication easier and more secure for developers everywhere.
