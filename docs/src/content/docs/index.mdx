## What is Aura Auth

**Aura Auth** is an open-source authentication and authorization library for modern TypeScript applications.  
Inspired by [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/), it delivers a **type-safe**, **framework-agnostic**, and **modular** API to implement secure authentication flows with first-class support for OAuth 2.0.

Aura Auth focuses on three core pillars:

- **Security** — strong, opinionated defaults
- **Developer Experience** — simple ergonomics, complete TypeScript support
- **Modularity** — use only the features you need

<Callout type="info">
  This project is under active development. Aura Auth is framework-agnostic and targets native TypeScript runtimes. If you'd like
  to contribute framework adapters (Express, Hono, Next.js, etc.), contributions and PRs are always welcome.
</Callout>

## Why does Aura Auth exist?

Aura Auth exists thanks to Auth.js, which has been one of the most important and useful authentication libraries for JavaScript applications in recent years, providing a wide range of authentication methods for modern web apps, especially for `OAuth 2.0` and `OpenID Connect` flows.

However, on September 26, 2025, it was announced that the core maintainer team would be stepping away from Auth.js, which has now become a side project of Better Auth (an authentication framework for TypeScript). Consequently, as a previous Developer Experience contributor to Auth.js, the decision was made to create a new alternative authentication library for TypeScript applications, inspired by Auth.js.

Aura Auth is the spiritual successor to Auth.js — designed for the next generation of TypeScript applications.

## Secure by default (Philosophy)

Aura Auth is built on a simple philosophy:

> Provide a framework-agnostic, secure, and ergonomic authentication system — powered by open web standards like **OAuth 2.0** and **OpenID Connect** (coming soon).

Security is not optional. Aura Auth enforces best practices by default:

- PKCE on all supported OAuth flows
- Mandatory state parameters
- Cookie security (HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite)
- CSRF protection via JWS
- Verified redirect URLs
- Strong cryptographic guarantees

Aura Auth lets developers focus on building products — not re-implementing the same security layers again and again.
