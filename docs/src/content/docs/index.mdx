## What is Aura Auth

**Aura Auth** is an open-source authentication and authorization library for modern TypeScript applications.  
Inspired by [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/), it provides a type-safe and framework-agnostic API to implement secure authentication flows with an emphasis on **developer experience**, **security**, and **modularity**.

<Callout type="info">
  This project is under active development. Aura Auth is framework-agnostic and targets native TypeScript runtimes. If you'd like
  to contribute framework adapters (Express, Hono, Next.js, etc.), contributions and PRs are always welcome.
</Callout>

## Why Aura Auth exist ?

Aura Auth exist thanks to Auth.js, which Auth.js was one of the most important and useful authentication libraries for JavaScript applications during the last years, providing a wide range of Authentication methods for modern web apps and specially in `OAuth 2.0` and `OpenId Connect` flows.

But, on September 26 of 2025, was announced that Auth.js was leave to main for the core maintainer team and now is a side of Better Auth (Authentication framework for TypeScript), so, as previous Developer Experience contributor on Auth.js I have deciced to create a new alternative authentication library for TypeScript applications inspired on Auth.js.

## Secure by default (Philosophy)

The philosophy is provide a easy, powerful and secure agnostic-framework authentication library for TypeScript based on web standards flow like `OAuth 2.0` and `OpenId Connect` (coming soon).
