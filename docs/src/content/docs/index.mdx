description: Modern, type-safe authentication for TypeScript — built for security, extensibility, and developer experience.

## What is `@aura-stack/auth`

**Aura Auth** is an open-source authentication and authorization library for modern TypeScript applications.  
Inspired by [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/), it provides a type-safe and framework-agnostic API to implement secure authentication flows with an emphasis on **developer experience**, **security**, and **modularity**.

<Callout type="info">
  This project is under active development. Aura Auth is framework-agnostic and targets native TypeScript runtimes. If you'd like
  to contribute framework adapters (Express, Hono, Next.js, etc.), contributions and PRs are always welcome.
</Callout>

## Getting started

This guide walks you through installing and setting up a basic authentication flow using **Aura Auth**.

### Install

We recommend using `pnpm` in monorepos for optimal performance, but `npm` and `yarn` are also supported.

```bash
npm install @aura-stack/auth

```

<Callout type="info">Using `pnpm` in a monorepo improves install performance and disk usage.</Callout>

### Environment setup

Store all secrets and provider credentials as environment variables.
By convention, Aura Auth uses the following naming pattern:

- `AURA_AUTH_{PROVIDER}_CLIENT_ID`
- `AURA_AUTH_{PROVIDER}_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AURA_AUTH_SECRET` (used to sign and encrypt sessions)

Create a .env file (do not commit it):

```bash title=".env"
# 32-byte (256-bit) secret used to sign and encrypt sessions. Use a secure random value.
AURA_AUTH_SECRET="base64-or-hex-32-bytes"

# GitHub OAuth credentials
AURA_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
AURA_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
```

<Callout type="warn">Never commit your `.env` file. Always use a secret manager in production.</Callout>

### Create an Auth instance

Use `createAuth` to configure providers and obtain HTTP handlers that can be integrated into your router or framework.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { createAuth } from "@aura-stack/auth"

const auth = createAuth({
  oauth: [],
})

export const { handlers } = auth
```

The returned handlers include pre-built routes used in OAuth flows (`/signIn/:oauth`, `/callback/:oauth`, `/session`, etc.).
You can mount them in Express, Hono, Next.js, or any runtime that supports native Request and Response APIs.
