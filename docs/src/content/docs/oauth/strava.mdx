## Strava OAuth App

### Creating an OAuth app

The first step is create and register a [`Strava App`](https://www.strava.com/settings/api) to grant to have access to the user's accessible resources like `Get Authenticated Athlete` (Used by Aura Auth), `Activities`, `Clubs`, `Routes`, `Segments` etc. For more detailed information read [Getting Started with the Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/#account), [Strava Authentication](https://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/) and [Strava API v3](https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/).

Registering an Strava OAuth app includes:

- `Application Name`: The name displayed when users authorize the app.
- `Category`: The application category (Charity, Data Importer, Indoor, Mobile App, Performance Analysis, Prints, Social Motivation, Training, Visualizer, or Wellness).
- `Club`: The club associated with the application (based on the creating account).
- `Website`: The application's home URL.
- `Application Description`: A description of the application.
- `Authorization Callback Domain`: The domain where Strava redirects after authorization. It should end with `/auth/callback/strava` for both local and production environments.
  - Local: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback/strava`
  - Production: Set to your application's production URL.

## Strava Aura Auth

### Installation

install the package using a package manager like `npm`, `pnpm` or `yarn`

```npm
npm install @aura-stack/auth
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Environment setup

Now, it's time to create and consume the strava credentials required and used by Aura Auth, it include the `client Id` and `client Secret` and write them into a `.env` file.

Additionally set the `secret` used by Aura Auth to sign and encrypt the user's session.

```bash title=".env" lineNumbers
# strava Credentials
AURA_AUTH_STRAVA_CLIENT_ID="strava_client_id"
AURA_AUTH_STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET="strava_client_secret"

# Aura Secret
AURA_AUTH_SECRET="32-bytes-secret"
```

<Callout type="warning">
  The `AURA_AUTH_SECRET` will recommended to be random and high antropy key to avoid attackers decifer the secret used by the Aura
  Auth application.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Configure the provider

Set the `oauth` option of the `createAuth` instance and writing `"strava"` name.

```ts title="@/auth" lineNumbers
import { createAuth } from "@aura-stack/auth"

export const auth = createAuth({
  oauth: ["strava"],
})

export const { handlers } = auth
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Get HTTP Handlers

Use the HTTP handlers to consume the authentication logic and flow the Aura Auth library to be integrated into routers and frameworks.

```ts title="backend.ts" lineNumbers
import { handlers } from "@/auth"

export const { GET, POST } = handlers
```

<Callout>
  The returned handlers include pre-built routes used in OAuth flows (`/signIn/:oauth`, `/callback/:oauth`, `/session`, `/signOut`
  and `/csrfToken`). You can mount them in Express, Hono, Next.js, or any runtime that supports native Request and Response APIs.
</Callout>
