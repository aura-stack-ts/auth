## GitLab OAuth App

### Creating a GitLab OAuth Application

The first step is to create and register a [`GitLab Application`](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/applications) to grant access to the user's accessible resources like `User` (Used by Aura Auth), `Commits`, `Deployments`, etc. For more detailed information read [OAuth 2.0 identity provider API](OAuth 2.0 identity provider API), [OAuth Scopes](https://docs.gitlab.com/integration/oauth_provider/#view-all-authorized-applications) and [Get the current user](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/users/#get-the-current-user).

Creating a GitLab OAuth app includes:

- `Name`: The application name shown when the user tries to grant access to the app.
- `Redirect URI`: The URL to which GitLab OAuth will redirect, it should end in `/auth/callback/GitLab` for local and production environments.
  - Local environment: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback/GitLab`.
  - Production environment: Set the URL of your production application.
- `Scopes`: Select scopes based on your application's needs. Aura Auth uses `read_user`

## GitLab Aura Auth

### Installation

Install the package using a package manager like `npm`, `pnpm` or `yarn`.

```npm
npm install @aura-stack/auth
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Environment setup

Now, it's time to create and consume the GitLab credentials required and used by Aura Auth, which include the `client Id` and `client Secret` and write them into a `.env` file.

Additionally set the `secret` used by Aura Auth to sign and encrypt the user's session.

```bash title=".env" lineNumbers
# GitLab Credentials
AURA_AUTH_GITLAB_CLIENT_ID="gitlab_client_id"
AURA_AUTH_GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET="gitlab_client_secret"

# Aura Secret
AURA_AUTH_SECRET="32-bytes-secret"
```

<Callout type="warning">
  The `AURA_AUTH_SECRET` is recommended to be a random and high entropy key to avoid attackers deciphering the secret used by the
  Aura Auth application.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Configure the provider

Set the `oauth` option of the `createAuth` instance and writing `"gitlab"` name.

```ts title="@/auth" lineNumbers
import { createAuth } from "@aura-stack/auth"

export const auth = createAuth({
  oauth: ["gitlab"],
})

export const { handlers } = auth
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Get HTTP Handlers

Use the HTTP handlers to consume the authentication logic and flow the Aura Auth library to be integrated into routers and frameworks.

```ts title="backend.ts" lineNumbers
import { handlers } from "@/auth"

export const { GET, POST } = handlers
```

<Callout>
  The returned handlers include pre-built routes used in OAuth flows (`/signIn/:oauth`, `/callback/:oauth`, `/session`, `/signOut`
  and `/csrfToken`). You can mount them in Express, Hono, Next.js, or any runtime that supports native Request and Response APIs.
