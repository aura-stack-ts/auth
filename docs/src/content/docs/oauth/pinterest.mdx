## Pinterest OAuth App

### Creating an OAuth app

The first step is to create and register a [`Pinterest App`](https://developers.pinterest.com/apps/) to grant access to the user's accessible resources like `Get User Account` (used by Aura Auth), `Media`, `Boards`, etc. For more detailed information, read [Connect App](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/getting-started/connect-app/), [Console Apps](https://developers.pinterest.com/apps/), and [Scopes](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/getting-started/set-up-authentication-and-authorization/#which-scopes-do-you-need).

Registering a Pinterest OAuth app includes:

- `Application name`: The application name shown when the user tries to grant access to the app.
- `Company name`: Name of the organization shown when the user tries to grant access to the app.
- `Company website or App link`: The home URL of the website.
- `Link to Privacy policy`: The link to the privacy policy of the app.
- `App purpose`: What the app does.
- `Developer purpose`: Select the purpose of the Pinterest App.
  - I am developing an app for my organization/personal use
  - I am creating an app just to get access

Once the app details are configured, the app is in `Trial access`, which tells Pinterest that the app needs to be reviewed. The confirmation or rejection is sent to the email.

- `Redirect URIs`: The URL to which Pinterest will redirect. It should end in `/auth/callback/pinterest` for local and production environments. Read [Configure your app's redirect URI](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/getting-started/connect-app/#configure-your-apps-redirect-uri).
  - Local environment: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback/pinterest`
  - Production environment: Set the URL of the application.
- `API scopes`: The scope of the app.

## Pinterest Aura Auth

### Installation

install the package using a package manager like `npm`, `pnpm` or `yarn`

```npm
npm install @aura-stack/auth
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Environment setup

Now, it's time to create and consume the Pinterest credentials required and used by Aura Auth, it include the `client Id` and `client Secret` and write them into a `.env` file.

Additionally set the `secret` used by Aura Auth to sign and encrypt the user's session.

```bash title=".env" lineNumbers
# Pinterest Credentials
AURA_AUTH_PINTEREST_CLIENT_ID="pinterest_client_id"
AURA_AUTH_PINTEREST_CLIENT_SECRET="pinterest_client_secret"

# Aura Secret
AURA_AUTH_SECRET="32-bytes-secret"
```

<Callout type="warning">
  The `AURA_AUTH_SECRET` will recommended to be random and high antropy key to avoid attackers decifer the secret used by the Aura
  Auth application.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Configure the provider

Set the `oauth` option of the `createAuth` instance. You can use the provider name as a string to use default settings, or use the `pinterest` factory function to customize the configuration.

#### Default configuration

```ts title="@/auth" lineNumbers
import { createAuth } from "@aura-stack/auth"

export const auth = createAuth({
  oauth: ["pinterest"],
})

export const { handlers } = auth
```

#### Custom configuration

```ts title="@/auth" lineNumbers
import { createAuth } from "@aura-stack/auth"
import { pinterest } from "@aura-stack/auth/oauth/pinterest"

export const auth = createAuth({
  oauth: [
    pinterest({
      scope: "user_accounts:read pins:read", // Custom scopes
    }),
  ],
})

export const { handlers } = auth
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Get HTTP Handlers

Use the HTTP handlers to consume the authentication logic and flow the Aura Auth library to be integrated into routers and frameworks.

```ts title="backend.ts" lineNumbers
import { handlers } from "@/auth"

export const { GET, POST } = handlers
```

<Callout>
  The returned handlers include pre-built routes used in OAuth flows (`/signIn/:oauth`, `/callback/:oauth`, `/session`, `/signOut`
  and `/csrfToken`). You can mount them in Express, Hono, Next.js, or any runtime that supports native Request and Response APIs.
