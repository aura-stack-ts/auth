## Why Aura Auth Simplifies OAuth 2.0

Before diving into the technical details, it's important to note how **Aura Auth** is designed to streamline and secure your implementation of this complex framework.

<Callout>
  **Aura Auth** is engineered to provide full, compliant support for the secure **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE**.
  By handling the secure exchange of the Authorization Code for the Access Token, Aura Auth abstracts away much of the underlying
  complexity, allowing developers to focus purely on business logic rather than security primitives.

## OAuth 2.0: The Delegated Authorization Framework [#oauth-authorization-server]

The **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)** published the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework in October 2012, documented under [RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749).

The **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework** is an **authorization** protocol that allows client applications to access a user's protected resources without the user having to share their credentials. It is based on the concept of **delegated authority**, where the user grants limited permission to a client application via a digital credential (**Access Token**).

### The Importance of OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is a fundamental solution implemented by major service providers like `Google`, `GitHub`, `Facebook`, and `Spotify`, among many others. Its importance lies in a key security principle:

> **Principle of Least Privilege:** It allows users to authorize third-party applications to access a specific subset of their data, limiting the risk in case the client application is compromised.

Although the OAuth concept is commonly associated with web applications, the protocol was designed to work with any type of client, including: `server-based web applications`, `Single-Page Applications (SPAs)`, `mobile applications (iOS/Android)`, `native desktop applications`, and even `IoT` devices.

## Core Principles: Authorization vs. Authentication [#core-principles]

It is vital for security to understand OAuth 2.0's primary role:

- **OAuth 2.0 is an AUTHORIZATION protocol:** It was designed exclusively to **grant access to protected resources** (What can the client do?).
- **OAuth 2.0 is NOT an AUTHENTICATION protocol:** By itself, it does not confirm the user's identity (Who is the user?).

However, OAuth 2.0 serves as the foundation for other protocols like **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**, which does add the authentication layer to securely verify the user's identity.

## OAuth 2.0 Roles

OAuth defines four essential roles to facilitate the delegated authorization process:

- `Resource Owner` **(User):** The entity (usually the end-user) who owns the protected resources and **grants the authorization** to access them.
- `Client` **(Application):** The system or application (web, mobile, etc.) that wishes to access the user's protected resources.
- `Authorization Server` **(AuthZ Server):** The server that verifies the user's identity and, after successful consent, issues the **Access Tokens** to the client.
- `Resource Server` **(API Server):** The server (the API) where the protected resources are hosted. It accepts the Access Tokens to validate requests and respond with the user's data.

## Authorization Grant: The Authorization Code Flow [#authorization-grant]

The **Authorization Code Flow** is the most recommended and secure authorization mechanism, especially for clients that can maintain a secret.

This flow is characterized by **not exposing the Access Token** on the browser channel (the _front-channel_), performing the credential exchange over a direct, secure channel between the Client and the Authorization Server (_back-channel_).

<Steps>

<Step>

### Authorization Request

In this step, the **Client** redirects the **User** to the **Authorization Server** (via the user's browser, or _User-Agent_). The request URI must include the following security parameters:

- `response_type: code`: Indicates the Client expects to receive an Authorization Code.
- `client_id`: The Client's public identifier.
- `redirect_uri`: The URL to which the Authorization Server must redirect the user. This URL **must be registered** and **strictly validated** to prevent malicious redirection attacks.
- `scope`: Defines the set of permissions the Client requests over the User's resources (Principle of Least Privilege).
- `state`: A **unique, opaque, per-session value** that the Client generates and verifies upon receiving the response. **CRUCIAL** for mitigating Cross-Site Request Forgery (**CSRF**) attacks.

<Callout>

**Security Enhancement: PKCE**
For **public** applications (like SPAs or mobile apps) that cannot safely custody a `client_secret`, the use of PKCE (RFC 7636) is **mandatory**.

- `code_challenge`: A hashed value sent in the authorization request.
- `code_challenge_method=S256`: The method used for hashing (typically SHA-256).

</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Authorization Response

Once the **User** successfully authenticates and **grants consent** to the Authorization Server, the server redirects the **Client** (to the specified `redirect_uri`) with two critical values in the URL:

- `code`: A short-lived, single-use **Authorization Code**.
- `state`: The original opaque value sent by the client. **The client must validate that this value matches** the one generated in step 1.

</Step>

<Step>

### Access Token Request

This is the most security-critical step. The **Client** takes the received code and exchanges it directly with the **Authorization Server** over a secure **server-to-server connection (back-channel)**.

- `grant_type: authorization_code`: Indicates the authorization grant type used.
- `code`: The code obtained in step 2.
- `redirect_uri`: **Must be identical** to the one sent in Step 1 to ensure integrity.
- `client_id`: Client identifier.
- `client_secret`: The Client's confidential secret. **(Optional, if PKCE is used)**.
- `code_verifier`: The un-hashed value of the `code_challenge`. **(Required if PKCE is used)**.

</Step>

<Step>

### Access Token Response

If the Authorization Server confirms the validity of the code and (if applicable) the Client authentication and PKCE verifier, it responds with:

- `access_token`: The main credential used to access protected resources.
- `token_type`: The token type (typically `Bearer`).
- `expires_in`: The lifespan of the Access Token (e.g., 3600 seconds). **Tokens should be short-lived.**
- `refresh_token` (Optional): A long-lived token used to request a new Access Token without requiring the user to log in again. **Must be stored extremely securely.**
- `scope` (Optional): The permissions that were finally granted.
