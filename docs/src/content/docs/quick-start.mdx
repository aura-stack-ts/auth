## What you'll learn

Through this quick start guide you are going to learn and understand the basics of how to set authentication using Aura Auth

- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
  - [Installation](#installation)
  - [Environment setup](#environment-setup)
  - [Aura Auth instance](#auth-instance)

## Getting Started

This guide walks you through installation, set up environment variables and create a basic authentication instance using Aura Auth for typescript projects and connection to the famous OAuth third party providers (`GitHub`, `Google`, etc).

<Steps>

<Step>

### Installation

Install the package. It's recommended use `pnpm` in monorepos for optimal performance, but `npm` and `yarn` are also supported.

```npm
npm install @aura-stack/auth
```

<Callout type="info">Using `pnpm` in a monorepo improves install performance and disk usage.</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Environment setup

Store all secrets and provider credentials as environment variables.
By convention, Aura Auth uses the following naming pattern:

- `AURA_AUTH_{PROVIDER}_CLIENT_ID`
- `AURA_AUTH_{PROVIDER}_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AURA_AUTH_SECRET` (used to sign and encrypt sessions/csrf tokens)

Create a .env file (do not commit it):

```bash title=".env"
# 32-byte (256-bit) secret used to sign and encrypt sessions. Use a secure random value.
AURA_AUTH_SECRET="base64-or-hex-32-bytes"

# GitHub OAuth credentials
AURA_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
AURA_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
```

</Step>

<Callout type="warn">Never commit your `.env` file. Always use a secret manager in production.</Callout>

<Step>

### Create an Auth instance [#auth-instance]

Use `createAuth` function to create the Aura Auth instance configuration which defines the [`OAuth Providers`](/docs/oauth) to be consumed, the cookie configurtion options and more configuration options to control the behavior and flows of the library.

```ts title="@/auth" lineNumbers
import { createAuth } from "@aura-stack/auth"

const auth = createAuth({
  oauth: [],
})
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Get HTTP Handlers

Once the Aura Instance was configured, it's ready to obtain HTTP handlers (`GET` and `POST`) that can be integrated into routers or frameworks.

The returned handlers include pre-built routes used in OAuth flows (`/signIn/:oauth`, `/callback/:oauth`, `/session`, `/signOut` and `/csrfToken`).
You can mount them in Express, Hono, Next.js, or any runtime that supports native Request and Response APIs.

```ts title="@/auth" lineNumbers
import { createAuth } from "@aura-stack/auth"

const auth = createAuth({
  oauth: [],
})

export const {
  handlers: { GET, POST },
} = auth
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Set up HTTP Handlers

Consume the HTTP handlers defined previously to access to Aura Auth authentication flow to `OAuth 2.0`.

<Callout>

The usage of the HTTP handlers depends of the library and frameworks integration, just, Aura Auth provides the endpoint for the `OAuth 2.0` flows which includes:

- `/signIn/:oauth`: Authentication to a `oauth` provider an known as `Authorization flow` in `OAuth 2.0`
- `/callback/:oauth`: Get the access token an as well-known as `Access Token flow` in `OAuth 2.0`
- `/session`: Get session of the active session
- `/signOut`: Signout the active session

</Callout>

</Step>
