## What you'll learn

This quick start guide covers the basics of setting up authentication using Aura Auth.

- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
  - [Installation](#installation)
  - [Environment setup](#environment-setup)
  - [Aura Auth instance](#auth-instance)

## Quick Start

This guide walks you through installing Aura Auth, configuring your environment, and creating your first authentication setup using OAuth providers such as GitHub or Google.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Installation

Install the package. Using **pnpm** is recommended for monorepos due to improved speed and disk efficiency, but `npm` and `yarn` work as well.

```npm
npm install @aura-stack/auth
```

<Callout type="info">If you're working inside a monorepo, prefer `pnpm` for optimal performance.</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Environment setup

Store secrets and provider credentials in environment variables.
Aura Auth follows this naming convention:

- `AURA_AUTH_{PROVIDER}_CLIENT_ID`
- `AURA_AUTH_{PROVIDER}_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AURA_AUTH_SECRET` (used to sign and encrypt sessions/csrf tokens)

Create a .env file (do not commit it):

```bash title=".env"
# 32-byte (256-bit) secret used to sign and encrypt sessions. Use a secure random value.
AURA_AUTH_SECRET="base64-or-hex-32-bytes"

# GitHub OAuth credentials
AURA_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
AURA_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
```

</Step>

<Callout type="warn">Never commit your `.env` file. Always use a secret manager in production.</Callout>

<Step>

### Create an Auth instance [#auth-instance]

The `createAuth` function is used to create the Aura Auth instance configuration. This defines the [`OAuth Providers`](/docs/oauth) to be consumed, cookie configuration options, and other settings to control the library's behavior and flows.

```ts title="@/auth" lineNumbers
import { createAuth } from "@aura-stack/auth"

const auth = createAuth({
  oauth: [],
})
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Get HTTP Handlers

Once the Aura Instance is configured, HTTP handlers (`GET` and `POST`) are available for integration into routers or frameworks.

The returned handlers include pre-built routes used in OAuth flows (`/signIn/:oauth`, `/callback/:oauth`, `/session`, `/signOut`, and `/csrfToken`).
These can be mounted in Express, Hono, Next.js, or any runtime that supports native Request and Response APIs.

```ts title="@/auth" lineNumbers
import { createAuth } from "@aura-stack/auth"

const auth = createAuth({
  oauth: [],
})

export const {
  handlers: { GET, POST },
} = auth
```

These handlers internally provide:

The usage of the HTTP handlers depends of the library and frameworks integration, just, Aura Auth provides the endpoint for the `OAuth 2.0` flows which includes:

| Route              | Description                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `/signIn/:oauth`   | Starts the OAuth flow (Authorization Request) |
| `/callback/:oauth` | Completes the OAuth flow and issues a session |
| `/session`         | Returns the current session                   |
| `/signOut`         | invalidates the active session                |
| `/csrfToken`       | Generates a CSRF token (for forms)            |

</Step>

<Step>

### Set up HTTP Handlers

Now integrate the handlers into your framework or router.

<Callout>
  Aura Auth exposes *standard OAuth 2.0 flows*, but does not enforce a routing framework. You decide how and where to mount the
  provided endpoints.
</Callout>

</Step>
