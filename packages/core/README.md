## Overview

`@aura-stack/auth` provides the **core logic and building blocks** for authentication and authorization within the **Aura Stack** ecosystem.

It offers a **framework-agnostic**, **type-safe**, and **secure** solution to handle authentication flows such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.  
Inspired by [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/), Aura Auth focuses on simplicity, developer experience, and strong security practices.

## Features

- **OAuth 2.0** — Native support for multiple OAuth providers.
- **Type-safe by design** — First-class TypeScript support with complete type inference.
- **Secure sessions** — Built-in JWT-based session management with encryption and signing.
- **Cookie handling** — Secure, configurable cookies for session persistence.
- **Extensible architecture** — Easily integrate with `@aura-stack/router` or custom routing layers.
- **Framework-agnostic** — Works seamlessly in any environment that supports the Web Request/Response APIs.
