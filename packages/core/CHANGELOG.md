## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added support for the `error` and `error_description` properties to standardize error handling in accordance with the [OAuth 2.0 RFC (section 5.2)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-5.2). These fields are used to describe errors returned by the application or by thirdâ€‘party authorization servers. [#2](https://github.com/aura-stack-ts/auth/pull/2)

- Introduced the `@aura-stack/auth` package which implements the OAuth workflow and exposes the `/signIn/:provider`, `/callback/:provider`, and `/session` endpoints. The package uses `@aura-stack/router` to define routes and is configured via `createAuth`, which accepts OAuth provider configurations and includes a default GitHub provider for convenience.
